## [Demo](https://waterrmalann.github.io/username-generator/)   |   [Source](https://github.com/waterrmalann/username-generator/blob/main/src/js/main.js)

A fully client-side username generator web app that can generate unique monikers. There is a pseudoword generator that can randomly generate pronouncable usernames and a mixword generator that combines randomly picked words from predefined wordlists in adjective + noun order. This project was written in HTML, SCSS, and vanilla JavaScript with a few dependencies.

This project borrows word dictionaries from [unique-names-generator](https://github.com/andreasonny83/unique-names-generator), [unique-username-generator](https://github.com/subhamg/unique-username-generator), and [moniker](https://github.com/weaver/moniker).

#### Dependencies

- [gpw](https://multicians.org/thvv/gpw-js.html) (*Pronouncable passwords generator repurposed to generate usernames.*)
